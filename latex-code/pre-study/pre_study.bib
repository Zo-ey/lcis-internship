abstract = {Summary Concerns about the future energy needs challenge energy experts to present advanced power grids making them smarter. Smart grids employ digital technology and are based on highly collaborative and responsive decision-making strategies. Current trends to control and manage their operation lead to the use of multi-agent system (MAS) technology. This paper aims to present the design, specification, and application of the Python Agent DEvelopment (PADE) framework, an open source platform implemented in Python language and conceived for the implementation of multi-agent systems on power systems. PADE is compliant with specifications of the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents and eases the development of solutions to power systems based on MAS. For demonstration of the effectiveness of PADE, an automatic restoration system MAS-based is presented. A test bed that encompasses agents embedded on computation devices is used to demonstrate the practical implementation of a PADE-based multi-agent systems in a power distribution network.},

This includes its core components: 1) the model (Model, Agent, Schedule, and Space), 2) analysis (Data Collector and Batch Runner) and the visualization (Visualization Server and Visualization Browser Page). We then discuss how agent-based models can be created in Mesa. This is followed by a discussion of applications and extensions by other researchers to demonstrate how Mesa design is decoupled and extensible and thus creating the opportunity for a larger decentralized ecosystem of packages that people can share and reuse for their own needs. Finally, the paper concludes with a summary and discussion of future development areas for Mesa.",

abstract = {Abstract To ease large-scale realization of agent applications there is an urgent need for frameworks, methodologies and toolkits that support the effective development of agent systems. Moreover, since one of the main tasks for which agent systems were invented is the integration between heterogeneous software, independently developed agents should be able to interact successfully. In this paper, we present JADE (Java Agent Development Environment), a software framework to build agent systems for the management of networked information resources in compliance with the FIPA specifications for inter-operable intelligent multi-agent systems. The goal of JADE is to simplify development while ensuring standard compliance through a comprehensive set of system services and agents. JADE can then be considered to be an agent middle-ware that implements an efficient agent platform and supports the development of multi-agent systems. It deals with all the aspects that are not peculiar to agent internals and that are independent of the applications, such as message transport, encoding and parsing, or agent life-cycle management.

	abstract = {The agent-based modeling approach is now used in many domains such as geography, ecology, or economy, and more generally to study (spatially explicit) socio-environmental systems where the heterogeneity of the actors and the numerous feedback loops between them requires a modular and incremental approach to modeling. One major reason of this success, besides this conceptual facility, can be found in the support provided by the development of increasingly powerful software platforms, which now allow modelers without a strong background in computer science to easily and quickly develop their own models. Another trend observed in the latest years is the development of much more descriptive and detailed models able not only to better represent complex systems, but also answer more intricate questions. In that respect, if all agent-based modeling platforms support the design of small to mid-size models, i.e. models with little heterogeneity between agents, simple representation of the environment, simple agent decision-making processes, etc., very few are adapted to the design of large-scale models. GAMA is one of the latter. It has been designed with the aim of supporting the writing (and composing) of fairly complex models, with a strong support of the spatial dimension, while guaranteeing non-computer scientists an easy access to high-level, otherwise complex, operations. This paper presents GAMA 1.8, the latest revision to date of the platform, with a focus on its modeling language and its capabilities to manage the spatial dimension of models. The capabilities of GAMA are illustrated by the presentation of applications that take advantage of its new features.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) often operate in a critical context where it is crucial that they behave as intended. However, the heterogeneous nature of CPSs makes them inherently challenging to develop. To assist in the development process, one can perform co-simulation, where models of constituents of a CPS are coupled to jointly simulate the full system. The challenge herein is to combine heterogeneous formalisms in a sound fashion and address practical needs such as stability, performance, platform compatibility and so forth. To address this, Maestro is a tool for co-simulation using models adhering to the Functional Mock-up Interface standard for co-simulation. Its development was driven by needs from different industry domains such as railways, agriculture, building automation and automotive. It supports both a fixed and variable constraint-based iteration scheme along with platform distribution capabilities. The tool is open-source as an attempt to increase adoption of co-simulation and encourage researchers to collaborate. Maestro has been validated by industry through application in the aforementioned domains. It is a step in the direction of the two-folded long-term goals: ensure trustworthy co-simulation results and make co-simulation a technology taken for granted.}

abstract = {Abstract Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have several applications ranging from the civilian to military applications. WSNs are prone to various hole attacks, such as sinkhole, wormhole, blackhole, and greyhole. Among these hole attacks, the sinkhole attack is the malignant one. A sinkhole attack allows a malicious node, called the sinkhole node, advertises a best possible path to the base station (BS). This misguides its neighbors to utilize that path more frequently. The sinkhole node has the opportunity to tamper with the data, and it also performs the modifications in messages or it drops messages or it produces unnecessary delay before forwarding them to the BS. On the basis of these malicious acts that are performed by a sinkhole attacker node, we consider three types of malicious nodes in a WSN: sinkhole message modification node (SMD), sinkhole message dropping node (SDP), and sinkhole message delay node (SDL). None of the existing techniques in the literature is capable to handle all three types of nodes at a time. This paper presents a new detection scheme for the detection of different types of sinkhole nodes for a hierarchical wireless sensor network (HWSN). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to design such a detection scheme in HWSNs which can detect SMD, SDP, and SDL nodes. In our approach, the entire HWSN is divided into several disjoint clusters, and each cluster has a powerful high-end sensor node (called a cluster head), which is responsible for the detection of different sinkhole attacker nodes if present in that cluster. We simulate our scheme using the widely-accepted NS2 simulator for measurement of various network parameters. The proposed scheme achieves around 95\% detection rate and 1.25\% false positive rate. These factors are significantly better than the previous related schemes. Furthermore, the computation and communication efficiency is achieved in our scheme. As a result, our scheme seems suitable for the sensitive critical applications, such as military applications. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Abstract—In the context of Smart Ecosystems, systems engage
in dynamic cooperation with other systems to achieve their goals.
Expedient operation is only possible when all systems cooperate
as expected. This requires a level of trust between the components
of the ecosystem. New systems that join the ecosystem therefore
first need to build up a level of trust. Humans derive trust from
behavioral reputation in key situations. In Smart Ecosystems
(SES), the reputation of a system or system component can also
be based on observation of its behavior.
In this paper, we introduce a method and a test platform
that support virtual evaluation of decisions at runtime, thereby
supporting trust building within SES. The key idea behind the
platform is that it employs and evaluates Digital Twins, which
are executable models of system components, to learn about
component behavior in observed situations. The trust in the
Digital Twin then builds up over time based on the behavioral
compliance of the real system component with its Digital Twin.
In this paper, we use the context of automotive ecosystems
and examine the concepts for building up reputation on control
algorithms of smart agents dynamically downloaded at runtime
to individual autonomous vehicles within the ecosystem.

	abstract = {The joint use of technologies such as IoT, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing or Virtualization has fostered the development of digital twins (DT). A DT is described as a physical entity, its virtual counterpart and the data connections between both. Digital twins are increasingly being used to enrich physical entities by exploiting different computational approaches, which are applied to the virtual twin part. One of such approaches is the multi-agent systems (MAS) paradigm. It is claimed they resemble DT in many features. In order to analyse the suitability of MAS for DT, this paper presents the results of a systematic literature review focused on the analysis of current proposals exploiting MAS to support the design of digital twins. We found that the integrating the multi-agent paradigm with digital twins can be challenging, because the distinction among them is sometimes blurry. Moreover, it has been detected that MAS are generally the interaction environment for the DTs, and data of the DTs allow agents’ better decisions to be made in real time. That is, the massive volume of data stored by the DT allows agents to make decisions based on these data, and on the other hand, MAS shapes the environment where the DTs operate and interact.},

	abstract = {The paper presents the multi-agent approach for developing cyber-physical system for managing precise farms with digital twins of plants. It discusses complexity of the problem caused by a priori incompleteness of knowledge about factors of plant growth and development, high uncertainty of crops cultivation, variety of weather, business and technical requirements, etc. The approach proposes knowledge bases and multi-agent technology in combination with machine learning methods for designing considered systems. Digital twin of plant is specified as an agent based on ontology model of objects relevant for plant cultivation (specific sort of plant, soil, etc) associated with history of operations and environment conditions. The architecture and functions of system components are designed. The expected results of system implementation and the benefits for farmers are discussed.},

	abstract = {An intelligent combination of the Internet of Things (IoT) and approaches to modeling and simulation is one of the most challenging endeavors for future cities, manufacturing industries, and predictive maintenance. Digital Twins take on a unique role here. However, the question of what a Digital Twin is and what differentiates it from a regular model is still open. We present an experimental setup for integrating an existing simulation model of Hamburg's traffic system with the city's real-time sensor network. The Digital Twin is implemented using the large-scale multi-agent framework MARS. The entire process from the model description to retrieving real-time data from the IoT sensors and incorporating it in the simulation is presented. As a first prototypical example, a multi-modal mobility model was connected to real-world bike-sharing locations in Hamburg. We find that the combination of multi-agent systems and IoT sensors as a Digital Twin shows enormous potential for city planners, policy stakeholders, and other decision-makers. By correcting the course of a simulation via real-time data, the corridor-of-uncertainty that is intrinsic to some simulation models' use can be reduced significantly. Furthermore, any divergence of simulated and sampled data can lead to a deeper understanding of complex adaptive systems like big cities.},

	abstract = {Context: In this paper, we study distributed and decentralized systems in which each part is modeled as an agent in a multi-agent system. Those systems provide more scalable and easier ways to control complex, distributed and interconnected systems of embedded components. We are particularly interested in methods to secure these systems. Objectives: This study aims to identify the main security properties studied, the parts of a multi-agent architecture that are considered most often in security studies and the technical solutions used to secure those systems. Methods: We conducted a systematic mapping study on research works addressing the security of multi-agent systems with embedded agents. We identified which security features were addressed, and their roles in global security architecture. Results: We identified 70 papers published in journals and conferences. We classified the extracted data reporting a tendency to focus on securing the availability of systems under attack by means of trust schemes, sometimes supported by cryptographic primitives. Conclusion: The use of cryptography appears to be limited in decentralized systems. However, solutions should be provided to overcome those limits as other solutions such as trust schemes do not protect the system from the same type of attacks.},

	abstract = {Smart grid is a typical cyber-physical system. In order to effectively evaluate the robustness of the system after cascading failures, combined with complex network theory, a cyber-physical system fusion cascading failure model is proposed. The power system adopts the AC power flow probability model to simulate the cascading failure process of the power grid. The information network constructs the corresponding scale-free network, according to the complex network theory and selects the node with the largest degree as the informative network dispatch center. The coupling model is constructed with the topological centrality index, the optimal scheduling process adopts the AC optimal power flow strategy. The simulation analysis of IEEE39 node system shows that the information network update will weaken the robustness of the system during the cascading failure of the cyber-physical system, the robustness of each transmission line increases nonlinearly with the change of the grid tolerance coefficient, and there are critical thresholds to make the robustness no longer enhanced. The enhancement of the coupling probability between networks also has a huge impact on the identification of vulnerable lines and robustness analysis of cyber-physical systems.},

	abstract = {Due to the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), logistics and supply chain operations have been digitally transformed. Physical objects are interconnected to perform real-time monitoring and decision support through cyber-physical systems. Besides machine-to-machine communications, humans play an essential role in IoT-empowered supply chain operations to monitor and configure IoT devices and interact with IoT systems for enhanced industrial intelligence. Extended reality (XR) technologies are exploited for immersive visualisation to strengthen the connectivity between human and cyber-physical systems. However, the role and development of XR in the IoT-empowered supply chain scenarios are not revealed. Therefore, this article attempts to introduce readers to the latest XR technologies and summarise significant research opportunities/challenges raised by the current literature to facilitate further interest in this topic. The systematic literature review process analysed 71 research articles from 1,207 relevant publications using text mining models, including the bag of words (BoW) and LexRank algorithms. Consequently, the article synthesises emerging XR solutions for human-cyber-physical interaction to guide the next-generation XR research for logistics and supply chain management. At the same time, human-centricity can be emphasised in future research agendas for Industry 5.0.},
